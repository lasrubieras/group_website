This is a repository for learning how to make webpages with Jekyll Pages 
This is from my participation in The Carpentries workshop.

When I want to have **bold** text, we use two asteriks around the bolded text.
To use _italics_, we can use underscores or a single asterik.  
If I want to print a \*, one can escape it? \*\*not bolded\*\*.


## Section 2

This is the first paragraph of this section. Simple formatting can be inserted simple by wrapping the text we want to formatwith asteriks. 
Simple pressing enter and moving to the next line does not insert a separating line between paragraphs.
An extra pair of spaces after the end of the lines does does the trick tho.  
See? You can see the line break now. 

A blank lines does insert a separator between paragraphs.
