This is a repository for learning how to make webpages with Jekyll Pages 
This is from my participation in The Carpentries workshop.

When I want to have **bold** text, we use two asteriks around the bolded text.
To use _italics_, we can use underscores or a single asterik.  
If I want to print a \*, one can escape it? \*\*not bolded\*\*
